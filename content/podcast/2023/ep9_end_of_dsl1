In this News and Views episode, [Phil Ewels](https://twitter.com/tallphil), [Chris Hakkaart](https://twitter.com/chris_hakk), and [Marcel Ribeiro-Dantas](https://twitter.com/mribeirodantas) discuss the hottest topics in the Nextflow world.

<!-- end-archive-description -->

#### The new 'fair' directive
- Addition of the new 'fair' directive.
- When `fair` is set to true the process outputs are ordered in the same sequence as the inputs were received instead of the first-completed-first-output semantic that's usually used.

#### The end of DSL1
- DSL1 is now not supported in the latest edge release - 22.12.0-edge.
- Can still run old pipelines with older versions of Nextflow.
- Can use `NXF_VER` before commands, good practice for reproducibility.
- All documentation and training should now be about DSL2.
- Should be less confusing for everyone.
- It has never been a better time to convert to DSL2.

#### Chatting with bots

- Late 2022 ChatGTP was all over Twitter.
  - Nextflow was featured in a tweet from [Andrew Lonsdale](https://twitter.com/LonsBio/status/1600266542876610560) showing a song about Nextflow using "New York, I Love You but You're Bringing Me Down" as a template.
- Stable diffusion
  - Evan Floden wrote a Nextflow pipeline for submitting jobs to the cloud using Tower as a proof of concept.
